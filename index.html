<p>
I am currently a Software Development Engineer in the Artificial Intelligence team at LinkedIn India. 
For the past year, I've worked on various research problems such as Scaling Nearest Neighbor Search for large datasets, designing a Hierarchical Clustering algorithm which 
  is implementable in practice, and am currently working on designing a novel Active Learning algorithm. My research interests are in designing machine learning algorithms for various applications. 
  I am also interested in interdisciplinary collaborations as some side projects.

<p>
  I obtained my Masters' from Indian Institute of Gandhinagar (IITGn) and was advised by Prof. Anirban Dasgupta. I was the Institute Gold Medalist in my discipline. 
  I also interned at LinkedIn in 2018 with guidance from Sreekalyan Sajjala and Rushi Bhatt. During my Masters, I also had the opportunity to collaborate with
  Chandan Kumar Jha and Prof. Joycee Mekie from the Electrical Engineering department.

<p>
  I obtained my Bachelors' in Computer Science and Engineering from Heritage Institute of Technology, Kolkata where I was advised by Prof. Partha Basuchowdhuri. I also had
  the opportunity to work on a project with Prof. Anindita Kundu in my third year there.
